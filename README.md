# Glossary Chrome Extension

Given a glossary in JSON format, parses the current webpage in search of any terms contained in the glossary. Then, when the user hover overs that term on the DOM, a tooltip-like pop-up appears beside the text accompanied by a definition and/or a brief explanation of the highlighted term.
